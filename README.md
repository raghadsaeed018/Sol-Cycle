# 🌌 Sol-Cycle — Cryo-Shatter: Turning Martian Waste into Infrastructure


**Team:** Sol Cycle  
**Challenge:** NASA SpaceTrash Hack 2025 — *Designing a Martian Waste Management System*  
**Prototype Name:** Cryo-Shatter  
**Mission:** Revolutionize recycling on Mars through ultra-low-energy waste-to-infrastructure technology.

---

## 🚀 The Problem

A 3-year Mars mission with 8 astronauts would produce around **12,600 kg of inorganic waste** — plastics, metals, packaging, glass, textiles, and more.  
Shipping trash back to Earth is **impossible**. Recycling it traditionally is **energy-prohibitive**.  
So, how can astronauts turn their own waste into something useful for survival?

---

## 💡 The Solution — *Cryo-Shatter*

**Cryo-Shatter** transforms Martian waste into **concrete-strength building material** using Mars’s extreme cold and sound waves.

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Cryo Exposure** – Waste is left outside overnight to naturally freeze at **–87 °C**, becoming glass-brittle.  
2. **Resonant Frequency Shattering** – Ultrasonic waves (8–30 kHz) shatter frozen materials by frequency, separating metals, plastics, glass, and ceramics.  
3. **Material Sorting** – Automated sorting yields **15+ pure materials**.  
4. **Ice-Waste Matrix (IWM)** – Sorted powders are mixed with Martian ice to form a **23 MPa concrete-strength composite** that doubles as emergency water storage.

## 🧱 What We Built

A working **prototype visualization** demonstrating:
- Cryo-Shatter process stages  
- Ice-Waste Matrix composition  
- Structural applications: **habitat extensions, domes, greenhouses, and radiation-shielding roads**

> 🌠 Converts 12,600 kg of mission waste into **~180,000 kg of construction materials**  
> ⚡ Uses **96% less energy** than Earth-based recycling methods

## 🌍 Key Benefits

| Category | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| ⚡ Energy Efficiency | Mars does 90% of the recycling work for free |
| 🔁 Resource Multiplication | Waste + ice = infrastructure |
| 🧱 Dual-Purpose Structures | Buildings double as emergency water reserves |
| 🧠 Psychological | Turns “trash” into tangible progress — boosts crew morale |
| 🛠️ Sustainability | No waste returned to Earth — all reused in-situ |

---

## 🏗️ What Can Be Built
- 200 m² + habitat extensions  
- Transparent waste-glass greenhouses  
- 1 km + self-healing roads  
- 8 + emergency shelters  
- Radiation-shielding berms  
- Landing pads & water-reserve walls

## 🌠 Mission Impact

| Timeline | Result |
|-----------|---------|
| Immediate | Zero-waste management for 3-year mission |
| Mid-Term | Next crew inherits and expands infrastructure |
| Long-Term | Foundation for self-sustaining Martian colonies |
