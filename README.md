# Sol-Cycle -- Designing Martian Waste Management System --

NASA SpaceTrash Hack: Revolutionizing Recycling on Mars 

CHALLENGE BRIEF 
During a hypothetical three-year mission to Mars and back, an eight-person crew would accumulate 12,600 kg of inorganic waste, or trash, including various packaging materials, textiles, and structural materials. This scenario creates a pressing need to recycle available materials, rather than execute the expensive and inefficient processes of transporting additional resources from Earth and/or sending trash back to Earth. As humans prepare to explore unknown worlds in the future, your challenge is to design sustainable systems that could manage, reuse, or recycle inorganic waste (“trash”) that is brought to and/or accumulated on the surface of Mars.
