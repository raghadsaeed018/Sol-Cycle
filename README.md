# Sol-Cycle -- CRYO-SHATTER RECYCLING SYSTEM üåè

Main Project Overview


THE PROBLEM

- 8-person crew generates 12,600 kg of inorganic waste over 3 years
- Shipping waste back to Earth or bringing extra resources is expensive and inefficient
- Traditional recycling requires massive energy (unavailable on Mars)



THE SOLUTION: CRYO-SHATTER

Uses Mars‚Äôs extreme cold (-80¬∞C to -125¬∞C) as a free industrial tool to transform waste into construction materials


HOW IT WORKS

Step 1: Cryo-Exposure

- Waste placed outside overnight in Martian cold
- Materials become glass-brittle (no energy needed)

Step 2: Resonant Frequency Shattering

- Ultrasonic vibrations at specific frequencies (8-30 kHz)
- Each material type shatters selectively into pure powder
- Metal, plastic, glass, ceramics separated automatically

Step 3: Ice-Waste Matrix (IWM) Creation

- Mix sorted waste with Martian subsurface ice (60% ice, 30% plastic, 10% metal)
- Pour into molds, freeze overnight
- Creates concrete-strength building material (23 MPa)



 KEY BENEFITS

Energy Efficient

- 96% less energy than traditional recycling
- Mars does 90% of the work for free

Resource Multiplication

- 12,600 kg waste + 120,000 kg Martian ice = 180,000 kg construction material
- Zero waste returned to Earth

Dual-Purpose Structures

- Buildings ARE emergency water reserves (melt walls in crisis)
- 40% better radiation shielding than pure ice
- Self-healing roads (thermoplastic particles flow into cracks)

Psychological Impact

- Crew sees trash transform into visible infrastructure
- Creates legacy for future missions
- Reduces resource anxiety



 WHAT WE BUILD

- Habitat extensions (200+ m¬≤)
- Greenhouses with transparent waste-glass domes
- 1+ km of self-healing roads
- Emergency shelters (8+ units)
- Landing pads
- Radiation shielding berms
- Water reserves in every structure



MISSION IMPACT

- **Immediate:** Zero-waste three-year mission
- **Medium-term:** Next crew lands on existing infrastructure (not empty desert)
- **Long-term:** Foundation for self-sufficient Mars colonies



 WHY IT‚ÄôS REVOLUTIONARY

Turns Mars‚Äôs greatest threat (extreme cold) into humanity‚Äôs greatest industrial asset‚Äîproving humans can build civilizations, not just visit planets



 THE VISION

From trash and ice, we build worlds.
